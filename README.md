# CQRS Extension for BeyondNet.Ddd 
This library provides an extension for the BeyondNet.Ddd framework, implementing the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern using MediatR. It enables developers to separate commands (write operations) from queries (read operations) for improved scalability, maintainability, and clarity in domain-driven design (DDD) applications.

**Key Features:**
Command and Query Separation: Simplifies the handling of write and read operations.
MediatR Integration: Leverages MediatR for in-process messaging and decoupled communication between components.
DDD Support: Seamlessly integrates with BeyondNet.Ddd to support domain-driven design principles.
Middleware Ready: Supports pipeline behaviors for cross-cutting concerns like logging, validation, and transaction management.

This extension helps streamline the development of distributed, maintainable, and scalable applications by encouraging best practices in DDD and CQRS.
